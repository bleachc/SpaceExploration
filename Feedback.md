What do you like about this group's project?


Space invaders clone isn't a bad game to work on. I do have some concerns with getting the firing mechanics done in time. But that's the last thing to make this work, which includes hit detection, health, and fire events for both players and enemies.

The group seems to be very confortable with Object Oriented Programming and is sticking to that paradiagm fairly religiously. However, I think this group would gain a lot of advantages using TypeScript if they continue to work with OOP.
 

What do you dislike about this group's project and what can they improve on?


I think the game was broken down into well defined chunks in order to reach a specific end goal by x amount of time. They've done well defining those chunks and delivering just those. However, this has left the game in an uncompleted state at every stage up to the final review and presentation. Ideally, we'd have a playable game no matter how small each week, but it's not a requirement, and this is more of a nitpick.
 

Do you have any recommendations for this group?


I really like the polish, but when you brought the projects together you lost some of that. I think tightening that up would really help on presentation. Really impressed with this. Touches a lot of JavaScript features, with a lot of stuff not covered in the classroom. I really want to get a student group to review this as I think there will be a lot of take aways.
